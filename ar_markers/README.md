# Fast, low latency fiducial marker detection on GPU in browser (WebGL)

Work in progress.

<img src="doc/images/image4.gif" alt="Video of the demo is loading..."/>

The work is part of [3D model scanning](https://github.com/intel/depthcamera-3d-model-web-demo)
implementation using depth camera capture in Chrome web browser: there are two
parallel approaches: ICP algorithm implementation and this one. Additional
benefit that the AR markers bring is marking a cut off plane separating scanned
3D object from the environment.

The algorithm description and additional demo links are [available here](https://astojilj.github.io/depthcamera-3d-model-web-demo/ar_markers/doc/Fastlowlatencyfiducialmarkerdetectionon.html).
